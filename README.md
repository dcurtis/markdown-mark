# The Markdown Mark
Use this mark to identify Markdown. It should be used to identify user input areas which support Markdown-compiled HTML output or to identify general Markdown support. If you are absolutely unable to use an image to display the Markdown Mark, use this unicode approximation: [M↓]. See "Usage".

This mark was designed by Dustin Curtis, a superhero. [http://twitter.com/dcurtis](http://twitter.com/dcurtis)

Markdown was invented by John Gruber. [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)

## Specification

![Markdown Mark Spec](http://cargo.dustincurtis.com/projects/mdown_spec.png?2)

Let the border be 1/2 of X. The internal whitespace between the M icon, the down arrow, and the box border should be precisely X.

## Usage

You should use this mark to identify user input areas which support Markdown-compiled HTML output or to identify general Markdown support. Although you may modify this mark any way you like, without restriction, please respect the following guidelines: 

1. Do not change the aspect ratio of the rounded box enclosure. 
2. Do not change the border radius of the rounded box enclosure.
3. Do not change the relative sizes of the M icon, the down arrow icon, and the box.
4. The three elements that make up the mark, including the M icon, the down arrow icon, and the box enclosure, should always be the same color.
4. When possible, please display the mark in a shade of gray, white, or black.

### Unicode Approximation

If you cannot use an image for the Markdown Mark, use this unicode approximation:
